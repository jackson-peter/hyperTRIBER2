\item{data_list}{Named list of tibbles from extract_count_data}

\item{ref_base}{Character vector of reference bases (one per site)}

\item{design_vector}{Character vector: "control" or "treat" for each sample}

\item{min_samp_treat}{Minimum number of replicates with editing > 0}

\item{min_count}{Minimum total edited-base count across replicates}

\item{min_prop}{Minimum editing proportion (only used when both_ways = TRUE)}

\item{both_ways}{If TRUE, keep sites passing filters in either condition}

\item{edits_of_interest}{Matrix of ref->target pairs to consider}
